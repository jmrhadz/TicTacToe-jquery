# week-11-jquery-tictactoe

tictactoe.html is the main html file, and it runs code.js

I had originally made noughtsandcrosses.js, which used bootstrap to color match player moves and turn the winning 3-in-a-row tiles bright red, but I did a lot of it while I had covid and it turned into spaghetti

styles.css was used to turn markers even brighter red on hover, to really deter players from clicking invalid moves
